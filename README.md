# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a simple implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game in JavaScript. The game is played in the console, where the player competes against the computer over five rounds. It was built as a part of The Odin Project curriculum.


## Features
The game randomly selects the computer's choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
The player is prompted to enter their choice.
The game compares the player's and computer's choices and determines the outcome (win, lose, or tie) for each round.
The score is updated and displayed after each round, and the final score is shown at the end of the game.


## How to Play
Open the JavaScript console in your browser.
Paste the code into the console and press "Enter" to run the game.
You will be prompted to enter your choice: "rock", "paper", or "scissors" for each round.
The game will display the results of each round and your score.
After 5 rounds, the final score will be displayed, and the game will announce the winner.
